Enhancing independence for elderly: Context-Aware Assistant for Memory Support
ementia and Alzheimer’s disease are neurode-
generative disorders that impair memory, cognition, and daily
functioning. As the global prevalence of dementia increases, the
need for practical, accessible, and non-intrusive care solutions
becomes urgent. The study presents an Android-based appli-
cation created to facilitate the lives of those suffering from
dementia and for the special caregivers involved in medication
reminders, emergency contact access viewing visual identification,
customizable voice alerts for behavioral reinforcement, real-
time location tracking and secure caregiver-only modules. The
application developed using Android native functionalities focuses
on usability, security, and accessibility. Iterative development and
emulator-based testing demonstrated the results of overcoming a
strong potential improvement in patient routine management and
caregiver burden reduction. An extensive authentication system
ensures that authorized caregivers are the only ones who can
handle the relevant data. Patients, on the other hand, have an easy
read-only interface. The program works offline, guaranteeing its
reliability in low-connectivity areas. This shows how effective
mobility health solutions can come to support people’s cognition
decline and thus increase the general quality of their life and
autonomy.
